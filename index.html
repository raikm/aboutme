    <h1>Software Engineer & Student</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Raik and I am a master student in medical informatics.
        Currently I am working on my thesis. I became self-employed in May 2017 to gain experience in the e-health sector. 
        My aim is to improve the healthcare and I am open for new projects in that! 

        As a compensation, I am creative in film and music production and I love to cook.
